      /* what is a funtion.
      A function lets us to reuse code.
      Rules for fuction, or syntax.
      function is define by word function and then given a name.
      same rules applies as variables.
      1-cann't use special words example fuction
      2-cann't start with a number.
      3- we cann't use special charactors.
      except: $ and _ are allowed.
      Best practice =useCamelCase
      inside the {} the code is called fuction body.
      the code only creates a function. it doesn't run the coe inside.
      functionname(); is calling the funtion or running the fuction or excecuting the function.

     /* function function1(){
      console.log('hello');
      console.log(2+2);
     }
     function1(); 
     */
    
      /* paramters are opposite of a return statement.
      Return=gets a value out of a function.
      Parameter= Puts a value into a fuction.
      A parameter works the same way as a variable.

      Syntax Rules for Parameter....
      1- Cann't use specail words example: function.
      2- Cann't start with a number.
      3- Cann't use special character except: $ _
      4- Best practice is to use camelCase.

      A parameter only exists inside the function scope. A function can have more than one parameter.
      Default value: Second function is using a default value as only one value 5000 is passed in function.
